# calculate-jaccard-similarity-between-sentences-documents
 Jaccard similarity function that measures the similarity between sentences/documents and provide a similarity score based on how similar the sentences
  are compared to each other.

The formula in notation is:
  J(X,Y) = |X∩Y| / |X∪Y|

In Steps, that’s:
  1. Count the number of members which are shared between both sets.
  2. Count the total number of members in both sets (shared and un-shared).
  3. Divide the number of shared members (1) by the total number of members (2).
